## Coast Capital Expense Tracker

### Business Problem
CC currently has a semi-manual expense claims system that is spreadsheet based. The
challenge with the existing system is that it requires users to download the latest version of the
spreadsheet to ensure the policies up to date (ie: mileage policy for car usage). As well, the system has
a manual approval process and does not include coordinated images for ease of approval. As a result,
CC would like to have an online system that allows their staff to easily navigate the
expense claim process.
